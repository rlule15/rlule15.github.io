        <strong>Career Goals:</strong> Become a Network Administrator in the
        Twin Cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Education:</strong> I earned an Associate of Applied Science
        (AAS) in Computer Programming from St. Cloud Technical & Community
        College, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree at Minnesota
        State University Moorhead (MSUM), expected graduation Spring 2028.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Passion:</strong> I enjoy working with networking because I like
        the idea of managing switches, routers, and firewalls while keeping
        devices secure. I also enjoy homelabbing — setting up new environments
        at home is both fun and a great way to learn new skills.
